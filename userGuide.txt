How to run
Move into the folder and compile the code from the terminal using:
    bash ./compile.sh

And run it:
    bash ./run.sh

Two konsole windows will be displayed:
1. One with a green cross (named ProcessA) and a blue button "P"
2. One (named ProcessB) completely black with one "0" corresponding to the center of the circle 
rappresented with the green cross in the first windows.

To move the green cross, it is necessary to select the "processA" window and click the arrows button on the keyboard.
When the cross moves, its position of the center will be displayed on processB window (plotting the distance between 
the previous center and the second center).

To print the circle in the current position, the button "P" on processA has to be clicked with the mouse and the image
will be saved in "out" folder.
